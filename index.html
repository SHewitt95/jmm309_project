        <h2>RSMAS</h2>
        <p>Aalekhya Reddam worked in the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS) as a receptionist in the Marine Department during her sophomore year of 2014. Her basic duties is to direct guests, inform her boss of any maintenance arriving and providing them keys, file sheets, help host events that the Marine Department have and many others.</p>

        <p>“In terms of doing the work, I had no problems,” Reddam, a junior majoring in Marine Biology, said. “RSMAS itself isn’t big so I never felt overwhelmed by an influx of people. Not many come out here. Sometimes it does get boring but it’s just some nice pocket money.”</p>

        <p>The department pays her $10 an hour. For Reddam who does research and have classes on the RSMAS campus, she thought that it would be a good way to earn some money in between class.</p>

        <p>“I had an awkward schedule where I have class at 2 p.m. and then have research late at 6 p.m,” said Reddam. “So to maximize my time, it was good to have the job. It gave me money, killed some time and allowed me to do some work as it was not that intense.”</p>

        <p>She said that she didn’t have much competition for the job due to the location being in Key Biscayne.</p>

        <p>“The only ones who want the job are those studying in RSMAS. It doesn’t make sense to come all the way out here otherwise,” she said. “Because of that, I was the only applicant and immediately got the job.”</p>

        <h2>Lowe Art Museum</h2>


        <p>Working on the main campus in the Lowe Art Museum is Robin Maynard who works at the reception front desk. A student is needed to meet and greet museum visitors, answer telephone and questions, admit visitors and complete basic office duties.</p>

        <p>“It’s pretty simple work,” Maynard said. “For our orientation, we learnt everything we needed to know, which made it easy.”</p>

        <p>The only problem he has with the job is that it is boring, citing that there is nothing for him to do during his work hours.</p>

        <p>“It is very easy to do. If you can even do your job,” he said. “Not many people come to the museum when I work.”</p>

        <p>For $8.05 an hour, he doesn’t earn much but for an on campus job, he is content with it.</p>

        <p>“I am an international student from France so I can’t apply for jobs outside of school,” he said. “At least this is something for me to do and get some money.</p>

        <h2>Net Zero Water Project</h2>

        <p>“Water is one of the most interesting things to research. Everyone knows the statistic that water covers 70 percent of the world, but no one talks about the fact less than two and a half percent of it is clean. Clean does not always mean drinkable.”</p>

        <p>Lucien Gassie, a PhD student at the University of Miami, is the student running a project tasked to collect water around the University of Miami campus.</p>

        <p>The program, simply put, collects water from the University Village for the “Net Zero Water Project.” Once the water is delivered to the School of Engineering, the water is tested for various qualities such as the level of PH, chlorine, Haloacetic Acids, fluoride, nickel, nitrate, hardness and other qualities. </p>

        <p>The job teaches students invaluable skills, especially science or medical related majors. Requiring between 10 to 14 hours per week, paying 10 dollars per hour, the hands on work allows for excellent on the job training.</p>

        <p>Some other tasks may include help with website maintenance and outreach. While they claim to have a website, their page on the University website is not currently active.</p>

        <p>“This work can be directly translated to any science related sample analysis. Most jobs like this one, the interns are runners, bringing samples from one employee to another. This job gives students the ability to actually do something.”</p>

        <p>“There is a direct correlation between a person’s health and the quality of the water,” Gassie says. </p>

        <p>Gassie makes the point that their job is to evaluate and monitor, not treat or work with the Miami Dade Water and Sewer department.</p>

        <p>“Miami is at an interesting juncture because of the melting ice in the poles and climate shift. It is important to keep an eye on the water and make sure that we are doing everything we can as a community to stay on top of this.”</p>

        <p>After mentioning I was from New York his eyes lit up, “do you see the difference in your skin while you are in New York compared to when you are down here?”</p>

        <p>I told him I had not, other than the well-known claim that New York makes the best bagels because of the water. However, he continued to make his point, “there is scientific proof in that, New York has cleaner drinking water.”</p>

        <p>Gassie went on to explain that New York water is harder and naturally cleaner than Miami water, resulting in drier skin.</p>

        <p>“You can even see the slight differences in the Miami area: Coral Gables versus Miami Beach, or even Coconut Grove compared to the University campus.”</p>

        <p>Gassie assured me that the water on campus was clean, “when you are looking to come to the University of Miami you will never hear someone did not want to come here because of the water.” He did not wish to comment when asked about the shower situation in the University dorms and housing.</p>
